            <h1>Dear Future Self,</h1>
            <p>As you embark on your next transdisciplinary innovation project with an industry partner, this journey map will serve as your compass through the complex terrain ahead. If you remember the exciting 3 months during IIP, we had the privilege of working with The Strategy Group on a project that was working to shift mindsets around AI to improve workplace efficiencies across the industry. 
               The duration of the AI User Readiness and Awareness project (AURA) taught me (and you!) valuable lessons about navigating challenge spaces, managing stakeholder and client relationships, and delivering meaningful solutions. I’ve prepared here a timeline of methodologies, approaches, processes, and principles to help you along in your new project. <strong>(Click the cards to view more in-depth!)</strong>

                <p>Your first instinct will be to create a linear path from problem to solution. Resist this urge.

Accept that your journey will be far from linear and prepare mentally for the emotional rollercoaster ahead.</p>

                        <li><strong>Actant Mapping:</strong> Start here to identify all stakeholders, both human and non-human elements in your system. Don't limit yourself to obvious players – the most impactful solutions often address overlooked actants. But also note that a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach can also limit the success of your intervention. 
                            Be flexible and work with your clients to determine the best way forward!</li>
                        <li><strong>System Mapping and Actor Constellations:</strong> Use these methods to understand relationships and power dynamics between stakeholders. Identify who is most affected, currently, as well as secondary, as this will help you identify where your intervention can have maximum impact.</li>
                        <li><strong>Miro Board Setup and Organisation:</strong> Set up a digital workspace as your "central hub" from day one. Miro works exceptionally well for teams and is accepted across the industry. Allocate sections for each week, incorporate weekly challenges, and maintain a running to-do list. 
                            Keep a record of all methods, explorations, research and ideas in an organised timeline, good for future reference and overall management. This organisation will prevent overwhelm when information and ideas start flowing in!</li>

                        Your solution's success depends on how well you understand and serve these central actants, throughout the whole process.</p>

                <p>Don't underestimate the power of conversations with real people. Primary research through interviews across various industries, generations, and organisational levels will reveal insights that desk alone research cannot. However, complement this with extensive secondary research to understand the broader landscape - in our case, 
                    the overwhelming array of available AI tools was a key insight gained from various interviews that shaped our final intervention.</p>

                        <li><strong>Ball in the Basin Method:</strong> Use this to understand system dynamics and identify leverage points.

                        More importantly, we found they were generally positive about AI's potential when implemented correctly - this insight shaped AURA's entire approach.</p>

                        <li><strong>Quote-Based Ideation:</strong> : This method, recommended by our mentor, was transformational to say the least. Select powerful quotes from interviews that capture the essence of user needs, then rapidly ideate solutions around them. This grounds your innovation in real human experiences rather than assumptions.</li>
                        <li><strong>"Yes, And..." Method:</strong> As you approach prototyping, use this method to question potential pitfalls and opportunities constructively and optimistically.

                            Ask yourself: "What are the essential elements that prove this concept works?" Build those first, make it fancy later!</li>
                        <li><strong>"Fail Fast" Mentality:</strong> Embrace extensive prototyping specifically to test assumptions and uncover limitations before significant resource investment. Create multiple versions quickly to identify potential issues like over-complexity, user fatigue, or accessibility barriers.

                        <li><strong>Value Proposition Alignment:</strong> Ensure your solution supports your partner's broader business strategy. AURA was designed to enhance TSG's AI policy offering and support their commitment to an AI-ready workforce, creating mutual value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sustainability Planning:</strong> Consider economic, social, environmental, and ethical factors from the beginning. Discuss implementation models (like our "software as a service" approach) early to ensure viability for all stakeholders.</li>

                    <li><strong>Embrace Collaborative Vulnerability:</strong> Be willing to share incomplete ideas, admit when you're stuck, and ask for help. The best solutions emerge from collective intelligence, not individual expertise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan for Sustainability:</strong> Consider long-term viability across economic, social, environmental, and ethical dimensions from the beginning. Short-term solutions that create long-term problems serve no one.</li>
